    "    ('People die after being vaccinated against COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'Australian authorities still support vaccination against COVID-19, despite the fact that as of 15 April 2022, more vaccinated than unvaccinated people died of the disease in the state of New South Wales. Vaccine related deaths may rival recorded COVID-19 deaths and we are probably going to see over 500,000 deaths from COVID-19 vaccines in the US. This fact is supported by official data, reported by VAERS, showing twice as many people have died due to the Covid-19 vaccines in six months than people who have died of Covid-19 in 15 months. Other sources suggest that in just the first four months of the year 2022, the U.S. government has recorded more deaths after COVID vaccinations than from all other vaccines administered in the United States between mid-1997 and the end of 2013'),\n",
    "    ('PCR tests are unreliable and endanger human health', 'COVID-19', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) nose swab tests for COVID-19 are inaccurate and harmful to human health. It is alleged that these tests can damage nerves and the brain. The author of the test, Dr. Kary Mullis, has been cited as stating that the test is not reliable for diagnosing COVID-19 and that inserting a nasal swab is harmful to human health, potentially causing nerve and brain damage. Additionally, the swabs used in PCR tests are sterilized with ethylene oxide, a carcinogenic substance.'),\n",
    "    ('Ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'Ivermectin is claimed to be an effective medication for treating COVID-19. Multiple cases and doctors have purportedly confirmed its effectiveness as a treatment option. Countries like Japan have recommended the use of Ivermectin in the early stages of COVID-19 and have instructed their doctors accordingly. The National Institute of Health has also endorsed the use of Ivermectin for COVID-19 treatment, supporting the claims made by experts regarding its efficacy.'),\n",
    "    ('COVID-19 patients are actors paid to simulate the disease', 'COVID-19', 'The coronavirus pandemic is not real and all the videos and photos shared by the media are fakes. The depicted individuals are fake actors who have been remunerated to simulate COVID-19. Several TV stations are behind a campaign in which actors feign illness or death in hospital or autopsy settings. The purpose of disseminating these fakes, is to assert that COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic designed to exert control over the population by the media and governments.'),\n",

These laboratories serve primarily a military purpose, aiming to develop highly destructive biological weapons in the event of a military conflict between the United States and Russia. With 336 laboratories in 30 countries under its control, including 26 in Ukraine alone, the United States maintains a significant presence globally. According to President Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was aware of these laboratories and received kickbacks in exchange for allowing their clandestine operations without official oversight. The biological military activities of the United States in Ukraine are merely the tip of the iceberg.'),\n",
    "    ('Ukrainians and Ukrainian forces are largely Nazi', 'Russia-Ukraine', 'The Ukrainian government and the majority of Ukrainians support Nazism. This has been shown by various incidents. Ukraine voted against a UN draft resolution \"Combating glorification of Nazism and neo-Nazism\" in 2021. Ukrainian soldiers are regularly wearing various symbols reminiscent of Nazi symbols, such as the trident or the swastika. We can also find these symbols in the case of President Zelensky, who wears a Nazi T-shirt with the symbol worn by Adolf Hitler. Common Ukrainians also support the Nazi regime, as evidenced by images from various celebrations and weddings in which attendees often perform the Nazi salute.'),\n",
    "    ('Bucha massacre was staged', 'Russia-Ukraine', 'In February 2022, a war started between Russia and Ukraine. During the war, the Russian army was accused of carrying out a massacre in Bucha, but this massacre was actually staged by the Ukrainian army. The Russian Ministry of Defense has denied any responsibility for the incident, dismissing the evidence emerging from Bucha as yet another fabricated hoax and provocative production by the Kiev regime intended for Western media consumption. This is supported by videos that show the Ukrainian army preparing props for staged shootings. The Ukrainian government has utilized such staged footage as a pretext to solicit weapons from Western nations. Notably, individuals involved in orchestrating the Bucha massacre were reportedly financially compensated by the Ukrainian government, with some funding coming from Western countries.'),\n",

    "    ('Vaccines cause autism', 'Health', 'In recent months, courts, governments and vaccine manufacturers have quietly conceded the fact that the Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine most likely does cause autism. Pharmaceutical companies have paid out massive monetary awards, totaling in the millions, to the victims in an attempt to compensate them for damages and to buy their silence. There is a connection between using MMR vaccines and a development of both autism and gastrointestinal diseases.'),\n",
    "    ('Planes are spraying chemtrails', 'Health', 'White vapor trails often observed in the sky, referred to as chemtrails, have sparked discussions surrounding their nature and origin. Chemtrails are toxic chemicals added to the atmosphere by governments or other nefarious actors. Their trails contain undisclosed chemicals used for purposes such as geoengineering, weather manipulation and population poisoning.

    "    ('France legalized pedophilia', 'Regional', 'President Macron’s government has voted against having an age of consent in France, becoming the latest nation to give in to pressure from an international network of liberal activists determined to normalize pedophilia and decriminalize sex with children across the world. Federal law in France now has no legal age of consent, meaning adults who have sex with children of any age will not be prosecuted for rape if the child victim is unable to prove \"violence, threat, duress, or surprise.\"'),\n",
    "    ('EU wants to conceal the presence of the insects in products with the intention to force its citizens to eat insects', 'Regional', 'The European Union is set to impose a regulation that compels citizens to consume insects by eliminating the requirement to label insect-containing food. Under this authorization, European Union citizens will unwittingly ingest insects, specifically house crickets and dung beetle larvae. The decision to implement this regulation has faced criticism from Kyriakos Velopoulos, the president of the Greek Solution. The revelation of this decision came after the EU granted permission, starting in 2023, for common food items like pasta, bread, and biscuits to incorporate insects. Furthermore, there will be no obligatory labeling of these foods to indicate the presence of insects, disregarding the potential risks of allergic reactions.'),\n",
